# Sorting-algorithm-Visualizer
Overview
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a web-based tool that allows users to visualize the process of sorting algorithms. This project is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work by providing an interactive and visual representation of the sorting process.

Features
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Supports visualization for 10 different sorting algorithms.
Interactive Controls: Users can control the speed of the sorting process and adjust the size of the array.
Random Color Function: Each sorting algorithm is represented with different colors to enhance the visual experience.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Technology Used
HTML: For structuring the web page.
CSS: For styling and enhancing the visual appeal.
JavaScript: For implementing the sorting algorithms and interactive features.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Used as the primary code editor for the project
